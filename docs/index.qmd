## What is AKSDB v2?

AKSDB v2 is a **data + metadata + governance** system for assembling many heterogeneous soil datasets into a consistent, auditable set of **harmonized outputs**—while preserving provenance back to source datasets.

It is designed around four ideas:

- **Stable IDs** for long-lived references (machines + citations)
- **Human slugs** for readable URLs and docs navigation
- **Releases** to publish coherent snapshots of schema + vocab + mappings + products
- **Checksums/manifests** to guarantee integrity and reproducibility

If you remember one thing: *AKSDB is built so that you can always answer “what is this, where did it come from, and what changed?”*

## How to use this documentation

Use this book in one of three ways:

### 1) Read it end-to-end (recommended for contributors)
Start with **Concepts** → **Registry** → **Vocab/Glossary** → **Mapping** → **Products** → **Governance**.

### 2) Jump in based on your task
- **Adding a new source dataset?** Go to **Datasets** and **Mapping**
- **Publishing a harmonized output?** Go to **Products**, **Standards**, and **Releases**
- **Changing schema/vocab/rules?** Go to **Governance**
- **Confused by a term?** Go to **Glossary**
- **Need allowable values?** Go to **Vocab**

### 3) Use it as a reference
Think of **Registry / Vocab / Glossary** as the “API docs” for AKSDB.

## The AKSDB object model (bird’s-eye view)

AKSDB documentation is organized around a few “objects” you’ll see everywhere:

| Object | Key | Where documented | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Dataset** | `ds_iid` | Datasets | A source dataset (pre-harmonization) |
| **Product** | `product_slug` (+ canonical ID) | Products | A harmonized publishable output |
| **Entity** | canonical entity ID | Registry | A described thing (table/file/layer/artifact) |
| **Party** | canonical party ID | Registry | A person or organization |
| **Role** | controlled vocab | Vocab + Standards | Attribution and responsibility |
| **Term** | `term_id` | Glossary | Canonical definition used across docs |

## Public vs private (two-repo worldview)

AKSDB v2 usually operates as two surfaces:

- **Private workspace**: raw inputs, restricted datasets, internal notes, intermediate artifacts
- **Public repo**: harmonized products, documentation, open metadata, citations

This book aims to describe the system in a way that supports both—without leaking private data.

## Guarantees (what AKSDB tries to make true)

AKSDB v2 aims for:

- **Referential stability:** IDs don’t change once published
- **Reproducibility:** releases can be rebuilt (same inputs + same rules)
- **Traceability:** products can be traced to datasets and mapping rules
- **Controlled language:** vocabularies and glossary prevent “semantic drift”
- **Governed change:** schema and rules evolve with explicit deprecation/versioning

## Where to go next

If you are new to the project:

1. Read [Getting Started](getting-started.qmd)
2. Read [Concepts](concepts/concepts--index.qmd) (IDs → slugs → releases → checksums)
3. Skim [Registry](registry/registry--index.qmd) to understand the metadata spine
4. Use [Examples](examples/examples--index.qmd) to do real work quickly

## Citation and licensing

AKSDB v2 is intended to be **citable** at multiple levels:

- the overall project/release
- each harmonized product
- each source dataset (original citation preserved)

(See **Standards** for how we align with DataCite / EML, and how roles map to CRediT.)

## Project status

This documentation is evolving alongside:
- the registry tables and controlled vocabularies,
- mapping rules for key sources,
- and the first “stable” harmonized product releases.
