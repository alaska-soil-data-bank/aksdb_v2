## What this book is

This Quarto book is the documentation hub for **Alaska Soil Data Bank (AKSDB) project v2**.

It explains:
- the **core mental model** (IDs, slugs, releases, checksums),
- the **metadata registry** (packages, entities, parties, roles),
- controlled vocabularies and canonical terms,
- dataset pages (per source dataset),
- harmonized products (public outputs),
- mappings/crosswalk rules,
- standards alignment (EML, DataCite, CRediT),
- governance (how change happens).

## Where things live

- `concepts/` — mental model (IDs/slugs/releases/checksums)
- `registry/` — metadata registry tables + field-level documentation
- `vocab/` — controlled vocabularies (enums, roles, status fields)
- `glossary/` — canonical definitions (term pages)
- `datasets/` — per-source dataset pages (keyed by `ds_iid`)
- `products/` — harmonized outputs (keyed by `product_slug`)
- `mapping/` (or `mappings/`) — crosswalks + transformation rules
- `standards/` — EML / DataCite / CRediT references + mappings
- `governance/` — versioning, deprecation, schema/doc change process
- `examples/` — minimal worked examples and templates

## Build the book locally

From the repo root:

```bash
quarto check
quarto render
```

The _quarto.yml currently sets the output directory to htmls/

## How to read and use this book (recommended path)

1. Start with Concepts (IDs → slugs → releases → checksums)

2. Read Registry to understand the “metadata spine”

3. Use Glossary and Vocab as references while reading datasets/products

4. Consult Mapping and Standards when publishing or extending outputs

5. Use Governance when proposing changes

## Public vs private

AKSDB v2 typically has:
- a private workspace containing raw/private data and internal notes
- a public repo containing harmonized outputs + documentation

This book is written to support both, while making the public surface area reproducible and citable.
