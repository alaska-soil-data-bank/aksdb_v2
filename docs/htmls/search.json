    "text": "What is AKSDB v2?\nAKSDB v2 is a data + metadata + governance system for assembling many heterogeneous soil datasets into a consistent, auditable set of harmonized outputs—while preserving provenance back to source datasets.\nIt is designed around four ideas:\n\nStable IDs for long-lived references (machines + citations)\nHuman slugs for readable URLs and docs navigation\nReleases to publish coherent snapshots of schema + vocab + mappings + products\nChecksums/manifests to guarantee integrity and reproducibility\n\nIf you remember one thing: AKSDB is built so that you can always answer “what is this, where did it come from, and what changed?”",
