## What the registry is

The registry is the **metadata spine** of AKSDB v2.
It defines the “who/what/where/why” across datasets and products:

- **packages**: publishable units / bundles (datasets, products, releases)
- **entities**: things described by metadata (tables, files, layers, artifacts)
- **parties**: people and organizations
- **roles**: how parties relate to entities (author, curator, funder, etc.)

## How to use this section

1. Read the table docs (structure + field meanings)
2. Use the data dictionary to enforce consistent meanings
3. Refer back here whenever you add a dataset/product page

## Registry docs

- [packages](packages.qmd)
- [entities](entities.qmd)
- [parties](parties.qmd)
- [data dictionary](data-dictionary.qmd)

## Design notes

- Registry rows should be referencable by canonical IDs
- Human-readable display names belong in slugs/labels, not in IDs
- Controlled vocabularies should be referenced, not duplicated
