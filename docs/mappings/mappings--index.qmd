## Why mapping docs matter

Mappings are where “interpretation” happens:
- column crosswalks,
- unit conversions,
- depth/horizon rules,
- categorical harmonization,
- join keys and entity resolution.

These docs make harmonized products defensible and reproducible.

## What a mapping doc should include

- Inputs and outputs (tables/fields)
- Rule statements (human-readable)
- Edge cases and precedence rules
- Examples (before/after)
- Version notes (what changed and why)

## Typical mapping topics

- Source → canonical field crosswalks
- Controlled vocab normalization
- ID assignment rules
- Checksums/manifests generated per run
