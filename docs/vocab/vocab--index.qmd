title: "Vocab"
subtitle: "Controlled vocabularies: enums, roles, status fields"

## What belongs here

Anything that should be **standardized** and **validated** belongs in `vocab/`, including:
- roles (aligned with CRediT where applicable),
- status fields (draft/published/deprecated),
- entity types,
- license identifiers,
- field-level enums.

## How vocab is used

- Registry tables reference vocab values
- Validation checks assert only allowed values appear
- Releases snapshot vocab at a point in time

## Start here

- Roles vocabulary (registry + standards)
- Status vocabulary (draft → published → deprecated)
- Shared enums used across tables
