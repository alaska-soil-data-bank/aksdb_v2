# credit_roles

This controlled vocabulary enumerates the allowed **CRediT (Contributor Role Taxonomy)** contributor roles.

The vocabulary uses a stable internal identifier (`concept_iid`) and a machine-friendly code (`term_code`) that can be used in structured metadata. The authoritative role descriptor pages are referenced via `exact_match_ids`.

## Controlled vocabulary file

- **Controlled vocabulary name / table name:** `/metadata/vocab/credit_roles.csv`  
- **Label:** CRediT roles

## Columns

| Column label | Column name | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Concept identifier | `concept_iid` | Stable, project-minted identifier for the concept. Recommended pattern for this vocab: `aksdb:credit_role/<RoleCode>`. |
| Preferred label | `pref_label` | Human-readable label for the role (as shown in CRediT). |
| Term code | `term_code` | Machine-friendly role code (letters only) used for clean programmatic identifiers. |
| Alternate labels | `alt_labels` | Optional synonyms / label variants. Multi-values are encoded as `{value1|value2|...}`. |
| Definition | `definition` | Short definition of the role (from the authoritative CRediT role descriptors). |
| Status | `status` | Governance status for the concept. Allowed values: `accepted`, `proposed`, `deprecated`, `draft`. |
| Created | `created` | Date the row/concept was introduced to the vocabulary in ISO format `YYYY-MM-DD`. |
| Modified | `modified` | Date the row/concept was last changed in ISO format `YYYY-MM-DD`. |
| Scope note | `scope_note` | Optional usage guidance and boundaries for applying the role. |
| Related identifiers | `related_ids` | Optional related concept identifiers (e.g., broader/narrower/hierarchical). Multi-values are encoded as `{value1|value2|...}`. |
| Exact match identifiers | `exact_match_ids` | External identifier for the authoritative role descriptor (CRediT per-role URL). |
| Close match identifiers | `close_match_ids` | Optional external identifiers for close matches (e.g., other role taxonomies). Multi-values are encoded as `{value1|value2|...}`. |
| Replaced by | `replaced_by` | If `status=deprecated`, the `concept_iid` of the preferred replacement concept. |
| Source | `source` | Human-readable documentation URL for the authority defining the vocabulary values (here: CRediT role descriptors). |
| Note | `note` | Optional editorial notes and provenance details. Multi-values are encoded as `{value1|value2|...}`. |
