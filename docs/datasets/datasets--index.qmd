## What a dataset page is

A dataset page documents a **source dataset** before (or alongside) harmonization:
- what it is and where it came from,
- spatial/temporal coverage,
- collection and processing notes,
- access constraints (public vs private),
- how it maps into AKSDB v2 entities/products.

Each dataset page is keyed by `ds_iid`.

## What every dataset page should include

- Summary + citation
- Access + license
- Provenance (who, when, how acquired)
- Primary artifacts (tables/files/layers)
- Known issues and QC notes
- Mapping links (crosswalks used)

## Dataset pages

- [MTJ Permafrost](datasets--mtj-permafrost.qmd)
- [KPU GAAR](datasets--kpu-gaar.qmd)
