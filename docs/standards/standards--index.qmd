subtitle: "How AKSDB aligns with EML, DataCite, and CRediT"

## Purpose

Standards provide interoperability and citation-quality metadata.

This section documents:
- which standards you reference,
- what parts you implement,
- how registry fields map to them,
- where you intentionally diverge (and why).

## Pages

- [EML](standards--eml.qmd)
- [DataCite](standards--datacite.qmd)
- [CRediT](standards--credit.qmd)
- [CF Conventions](standards--cf-conventions.qmd)

## Practical output

The goal is to support:
- a strong `CITATION.cff`,
- dataset/product citations,
- machine-readable exports (where appropriate),
- consistent attribution via roles.
