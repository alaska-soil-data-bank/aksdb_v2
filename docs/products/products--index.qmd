## What a product is

A **product** is a harmonized, documented output intended for reuse:
- tables,
- geospatial layers,
- derived indicators,
- releases of cleaned/harmonized datasets.

Products are keyed by `product_slug` (human-friendly), but should also carry canonical IDs and checksums.

## What every product page should include

- What it contains (schema + files)
- Intended use + non-use cases
- Inputs (datasets + versions)
- Mapping rules used
- Validation checks passed
- Change notes across releases

## Start here

Create product pages once:
- mapping rules stabilize,
- validation checks are defined,
- and you are ready to publish/release.
