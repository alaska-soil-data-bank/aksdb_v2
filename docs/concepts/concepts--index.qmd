title: "Concepts"
subtitle: "The AKSDB v2 mental model: IDs → slugs → releases → checksums"
---

## Why these concepts exist

AKSDB v2 is designed for:
- reproducibility (same inputs → same outputs),
- long-lived references (stable identifiers),
- safe evolution (versioning + deprecation),
- traceability (checksums + provenance).

Everything else in the docs assumes this mental model.

## The core chain

### 1) IDs
**IDs** are canonical, stable identifiers for machines and long-term references.
They should be:
- unique,
- immutable once published,
- never “meaningful” in a way that invites reinterpretation.

### 2) Slugs
**Slugs** are human-friendly names used for URLs and docs navigation.
They can change (with redirects / alias rules), but must never break ID-based references.

### 3) Releases
A **release** is a named snapshot of:
- schema,
- vocab,
- mappings,
- products (harmonized outputs),
with explicit compatibility expectations.

### 4) Checksums
**Checksums** anchor trust:
- detect unintended change,
- support manifests,
- enable provenance (“this file came from these inputs under this mapping version”).

## In this section

- **IDs & slugs**: what is stable, what can change, and how aliases work  
- **Releases**: what constitutes a release, and how we version it  
- **Checksums & provenance**: manifests, file integrity, and lineage  
- **Validation checks**: what we assert about tables and outputs
