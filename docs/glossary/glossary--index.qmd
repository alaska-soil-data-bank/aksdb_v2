subtitle: "Canonical definitions of terms used across AKSDB"

## Purpose

The glossary prevents “same word, different meaning” drift.

A glossary entry should:
- define the term precisely,
- list synonyms/aliases,
- specify scope (where it applies),
- link to related registry fields and standards mappings.

## In this section

- [All terms](terms.qmd)
- [Organic carbon](organic-carbon.qmd)

## Authoring rule of thumb

If a term appears in:
- registry field descriptions,
- mapping rules,
- product documentation,
and could be interpreted multiple ways—add a glossary entry.
